# Notepad

## Description

My motivation for this project was to make a simple program capable of recording notes and updating a database on the backend dynamically. Users will be able to add and delete notes on the front end, but this will affect the databse in the back end. 

## Installation

The webpage is available at https://github.com/zachcygan/notepad. Be sure to install any dependencies by typing in "npm i" in the console. This will install express, util, and uuidv4. 

The deployed application can be viewed at: https://shrouded-cliffs-99337.herokuapp.com/;
